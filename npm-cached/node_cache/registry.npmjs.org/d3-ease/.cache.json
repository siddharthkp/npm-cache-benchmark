d3-ease\n\n*Easing* is a method of distorting time to control apparent motion in animation. It is most commonly used for [slow-in, slow-out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12_basic_principles_of_animation#Slow_In_and_Slow_Out). By easing time, [animated transitions](https://github.com/d3/d3-transition) are smoother and exhibit more plausible motion.\n\nThe easing types in this module implement the [ease method](#ease_ease), which takes a normalized time *t* and returns the corresponding “eased” time *tʹ*. Both the normalized time and the eased time are typically in the range [0,1], where 0 represents the start of the animation and 1 represents the end; some easing types, such as [elastic](#easeElastic), may return eased times slightly outside this range. A good easing type should return 0 if *t* = 0 and 1 if *t* = 1. See the [easing explorer](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/248bac3b8e354a9103c4) for a visual demonstration.\n\nThese easing types are largely based on work by [Robert Penner](http://robertpenner.com/easing/).\n\n## Installing\n\nIf you use NPM, `npm install d3-ease`. Otherwise, download the [latest release](https://github.com/d3/d3-ease/releases/latest). You can also load directly from [d3js.org](https://d3js.org), either as a [standalone library](https://d3js.org/d3-ease.v1.min.js) or as part of [D3 4.0](https://github.com/d3/d3). AMD, CommonJS, and vanilla environments are supported.
